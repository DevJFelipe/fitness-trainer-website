# Plan Assignment Debug Results

## Issues Found

### 1. User Display Problem
- **Issue**: Users are not showing in UserAssignment component
- **Root Cause**: Filtering logic in TrainerDashboard is working correctly, but need to check data structure

### 2. Success Message Not Showing
- **Issue**: Assignment success message not appearing
- **Root Cause**: Need to verify if assignPlanToUser is working properly

## Debug Steps Taken

### 1. Added Console Logs
- Added debug logs to TrainerDashboard.jsx to check user data
- Added debug logs to UserAssignment.jsx to check props

### 2. Fixed Field Name
- Fixed user filter from `user.email` to `user.correo` to match database schema

## Next Steps

1. Check browser console for debug output
2. Verify users are being loaded with correct roles
3. Test assignment flow completely
4. Check if assignment service method is working

## Database Schema Notes
- `usuario` table has `correo` field (not `email`)
- Role IDs: 10=admin, 11=usuario, 12=entrenador
- Users are filtered by `rol.nombre_rol === 'usuario'`
